# Next.js Key Features and Benefits: App Router

## Current Status of the App Router

- **App Router in Development:**

  - When creating a Next.js application, you may be prompted to use the App Router. However, it is important to note that the App Router is still in development.

- **Server Actions in Alpha Testing:**
  - Server Actions, which are essential for working with form data and similar server-side interactions, are currently in alpha testing. This means they are not fully stable and may contain bugs.

## Working with Server Actions

- **Handling Form Data:**

  - We need a reliable way to handle form data on our server. Given the current instability of the App Router and Server Actions, it is prudent to avoid using these features for now.

- **Other Server Actions:**
  - Apart from handling form data, Server Actions are crucial for various server-side tasks such as:
    - **Data Validation:** Ensuring that the data submitted by users meets the required criteria before processing.
    - **Authentication:** Managing user authentication and authorization to secure access to certain parts of the application.
    - **Database Operations:** Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
    - **API Integrations:** Communicating with third-party APIs to fetch or send data.

## Building a Stable Environment

- **Creating a Bug-Free Environment:**
  - To ensure a stable and bug-free environment for our application, we will build our own solutions for handling form data and other server-side functionalities. This approach allows us to maintain control over the stability and reliability of our application.

## Benefits of a Custom Implementation

- **Reliability:**

  - By building our own solutions, we can ensure that our server-side interactions are reliable and free from the bugs that may be present in the alpha-stage App Router and Server Actions.

- **Flexibility:**

  - Custom implementations provide the flexibility to tailor solutions specifically to our application's needs, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

- **Control:**
  - Maintaining control over server-side logic allows us to quickly address any issues that arise and make necessary adjustments without relying on the stability of external features still in development.
