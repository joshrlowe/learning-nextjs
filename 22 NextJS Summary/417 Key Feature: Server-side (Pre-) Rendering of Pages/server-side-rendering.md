# Next.js Key Features and Benefits: Pre-Rendering

- **Fullstack Framework for React:** Next.js is designed to be a fullstack framework for React, enhancing its capabilities for building comprehensive applications.

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**

- **Concept:** SSR involves preparing the content of a page on the server rather than on the client. This means that the server renders the HTML content and sends it to the client, resulting in a fully-rendered page right from the start.
- **Typical React Setup:**

  - In a typical React application, there is usually a `div#root` where the React code is injected. All rendering then happens on the client side.
  - The initial HTML served to the client is often empty or minimal, which can lead to undesirable loading states when fetching data.

- **Problems with Client-Side Rendering:**
  - **Loading States:** Users might experience a noticeable loading state, especially when data is being fetched. The longer this state lasts, the more it impacts user experience negatively.
  - **SEO Issues:** Search engine crawlers primarily see the initial HTML content. With client-side rendering, this often means they only see a `div#root` without any meaningful content, which can hurt SEO.

## Benefits of Server-Side Rendering

- **Pre-Rendering on the Server:** If a page can be pre-rendered on the server, the fully-rendered page is served to the client immediately. This eliminates loading states and ensures that search engines can see and index the actual content.

- **SEO and Performance:** Pre-rendering improves both SEO and the initial load time of the page, enhancing the overall user experience and visibility in search engines.

## Next.js and Server-Side Rendering

- **Built-In Features:** While React does have built-in features that enable server-side rendering, setting it up correctly can be challenging.

- **Automatic Page Pre-Rendering:** Next.js simplifies this process by offering automatic page pre-rendering out of the box. This makes it easier to achieve the benefits of SSR without the complexity.

- **Blending Client and Server Side Rendering:**
  - Next.js allows you to fetch data on the server and render finished pages that blend client-side and server-side rendering seamlessly.
  - This approach ensures that users receive a fully-rendered page quickly, with the added benefits of server-side data fetching.
