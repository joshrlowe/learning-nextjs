# Next.js Key Features and Benefits: Routing

## Traditional React Routing

- **No Built-In Router:**
  - In traditional React, there is no built-in router. Routing is achieved through third-party libraries like `react-router-dom`.
- **Illusion of Navigation:**

  - Routing in React gives the illusion of moving around to different pages. The router watches the URL and prevents requests to the backend server, rendering React content instead without sending a new request.

- **Code-Based Routing Setup:**
  - Typically, routing is set up directly in the code. This involves writing more code and adding components that act as pages within a folder structure.
  - While this works, it requires additional effort and can make the codebase more complex.

## Next.js Routing

- **File-Based Routing:**

  - Next.js simplifies routing by eliminating the need for in-code definitions. Instead, it uses a file structure that directly supports routes.
  - Pages and routes are defined with files and folders rather than with code. Each file in the `pages` directory corresponds to a route.

- **Benefits of File-Based Routing:**
  - **Less Work:** Defining routes with files and folders reduces the amount of code you need to write.
  - **Less Code:** The absence of routing code means a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
  - **High Understandability:** The file-based structure makes the routes highly understandable, as they directly reflect the file organization.

## Dynamic Routes and Parameters

- In this section, we will explore how to work with dynamic routes and parameters in Next.js. This allows for more flexible and powerful routing capabilities, enabling you to create dynamic pages based on various parameters.
