# Next.js Key Features and Benefits: Adding Backend Code

## Fullstack Capabilities

- **Fullstack Framework:**
  - Next.js is not just a frontend framework but a fullstack framework, allowing you to add backend functionality directly within your React applications.

## Adding Backend Code

- **Standalone Backend Code:**

  - You can have standalone backend code that works seamlessly with the filesystem, enabling various server-side operations.

- **Ease of Integration:**

  - Next.js makes it easy to add backend (server-side) code to your React applications. This integration simplifies tasks such as storing data, retrieving data, and handling authentication.

- **Backend Functionality:**
  - By integrating backend capabilities directly into your Next.js applications, you can manage data storage, data retrieval, and user authentication without needing a separate backend server.

## Blending Backend API Code

- **Seamless Integration:**
  - Next.js allows you to blend backend API code with your frontend application. This means you can write API routes and handle server-side logic within the same project, creating a cohesive and integrated development experience.
